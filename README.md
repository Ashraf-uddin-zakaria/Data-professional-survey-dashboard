## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the company understand their employee better. It helps the company to know if their employee are satisfied with their policies. Through different ratings, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area.



### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : Removed some columns like 'Browser', 'OS' which only caontains Null values.
